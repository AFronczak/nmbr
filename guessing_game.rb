# [ ] Pick a random number between 1 and 100
# [ ] Prompt you for a guess
# [ ] If your guess is less than the program's number, it should tell you that you were low and let you guess again.
# [ ] If the guess is greater than the program's number, it should tell you that you were high and let you guess again.
# [ ] If your guess is correct, the program should tell you that you win and then quit.
# [ ] After 5 incorrect guesses, the program should tell you that you lose.
# [ ] Your code should use at least two methods. NOTE this doesn't say in a class -- but if you feel like there is a good data+behavior approach, go for it.
# [ ] This game should be run from the command line by typing "ruby guessing_game.rb".
